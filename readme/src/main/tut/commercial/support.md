### phantom-pro

`phantom-pro` is a heavily upgraded version of Phantom which includes several extremely powerful features that will not be available in the open source version, including and not limited to:

- Full online access to a complete set of phantom tutorials, accompanied by our direct support.
- Advanced support for integrating phantom with Apache Spark.
- A very powerful schema management framework called `phantom-migrations` which allows you not only to completely automate schema management and do it all in Scala, but also to let phantom automatically handle most use cases for you.
